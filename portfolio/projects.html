                    <p>Project Steelheart (also known as Pokémon Steelheart) is a Pokémon White 2 mod that aims to transform the base game into a new experience, complete with a new story, characters and gameplay modifications, all inspired by Pokémon Colosseum and Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The project started as a means for me to expand my portfolio to add character design, writing, and programming, but grew into a larger project that garnered a small following and prospects for continued development over several years. The project is also directly tied to me starting my career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Development ended due to time constraints and interests in other projects. There are thoughts about restarting the project later in life, but only after a team is built and I have the proper funds and time for it.

                    <p>Pokémon: Too Many Types is a Pokémon Emerald mod that adds 44 new types to the game, 118 new moves, and 3 typed Pokémon to name a few features. More information about the mod can be found <a href="https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/pokemon-too-many-types-as-seen-in-alpharads-video.501317/">here</a>.

                    This project is a commission by Alpharad that was completed in 3 weeks for streaming and recording purposes. I worked with two other people on the project, Kobazco and marinepez, to create our weirdest project to date.

                    There are talks about a potential sequel to the game, but we can’t spill anything just yet.

                    As an intern, I worked on storyboarding the intro and ending cutscenes for the game. This was my first time working with a studio, and I’m glad they were able to give me rapid feedback on my work while I was on limited time as a college student.

                    <p>Elementa is a 2D Momentum Platformer built in Unity. Its focus on maintaining momentum through slopes and homing attacks made it a fun speedrunning game within the small community.

                    It was one of the first projects I put dedicated time to, and was very proud of my progress at the time. It was shown off at BostonFIG 2020.

                    <p>“You will play as a hamster wizard, journeying through the land, encountering demonic critters who are trying to stop you.” Pip’s Quest is a generative dungeon crawler where each turn you are given a different set of spells to chain together. The enemies get stronger after each stage, and the game ends when the player is defeated.

                    <p>
                    I worked on UI and Background art for this class project, as well as generative design with everyone else.

                    There's not much more to say other than it’s a fun and simple gameplay loop for a project that took about a month of in class time to make.
